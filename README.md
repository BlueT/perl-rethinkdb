# perl-rethinkdb

A Pure Perl RethinkDB Driver

# notes

This is still in alpha stage. The implementation is not 100% complete. This version is compatible with RethinkDB 1.3. However, since RethinkDB switched to 1.4 (and with it a new ReQL) I am going to stop working on this version and switch to working on a 1.4 compatible version.
